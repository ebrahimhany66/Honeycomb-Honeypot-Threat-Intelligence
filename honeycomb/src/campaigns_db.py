"""Stage 3 - read sessions from `events`, run C1-C3, write `campaigns`.

Sessions are built straight from the events table (grouped by session_id),
so this does not depend on a separate sessions table.
The campaigns tables below are a PROPOSAL: agree on them with Member 2
(schema owner) and Member 5 (scoring reads them) before merging.
